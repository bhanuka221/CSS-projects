* There are 5 positions in CSS
* Default uses static.
  -> It says that follow the order. child-1 then child-2 etc.
*relative position 
  -> like static positioning but allow to do 4 things that static will not allow.
      1.can change top,bottom,left and right of a element
      2.It is relative to the static position (normal position where it's located in html page)
      3.It overalp parent or other child elements. 
      4.Typicaly tope,left,right,bottom not uses with relative as it hard to style
*absolute
  -> Use left,right,top,bottom with it.
  -> completely remove the element from html workflow. Treat it as it not exists anymore
  -> it will keep element absolute position relative to  parent element (make parent element some other than static(best use relative). then it will take as the relative postion for absolute)
 *fixed
  -> Fixed based on the entire HTML element. Nothing to do with parents
  -> Stay in the same place when scroll
 *sticky
  -> Combination of both fixed and relative position into one
  -> normaly play as relative. When scroll, it becomes fixed
